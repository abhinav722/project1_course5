# project1_course5
the following repository contains the redo of my course 5 -project 1. 
In order to access the graphs you must run the html file on the browser and not on the git hub repo 
I have also uploaded a word document which shows all graphs and output clearly 
## mean and median have been reported in the html/word document and also in a separate .md file 
plots have also been uploaded separately
